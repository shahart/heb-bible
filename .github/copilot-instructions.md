# GitHub Copilot Instructions — heb-bible

Purpose: give an AI coding agent the focused, actionable knowledge needed to make productive code changes in this repository.

- Big picture:
  - This repo contains multiple implementations and deployment targets for the same core Hebrew Bible tooling: a Spring Boot app (`sb3/`), several cloud function modules (`aws-lambda/`, `gcp-cloud-function/`, `azure-functions/`, `alibaba-function-compute/`, `tencent/`, `oracle-cloud-fn/`), client-side JS (`client/`, `docs/`), and small utilities in `go/`, `python/`, `c++/`, `pascal/`.
  - Each cloud provider module is largely independent and has its own `pom.xml`. Changes that affect the core library or data formats should be applied in the shared code and then adapted for each deployment module.

- Where to look first:
  - Spring Boot backend: `sb3/` (Spring Boot app). Main entry points, dependencies, and runtime instructions are in `sb3/pom.xml` and `sb3/src/`.
  - Lambda/function adapters: `aws-lambda/pom.xml`, `spring-cloud-function/pom.xml`, and `alibaba-function-compute/pom.xml` — these show handler names and expected packaging (`maven-shade-plugin` usage).
  - Utilities and language samples: `go/`, `python/`, `client/`, `c++/`, `pascal/`.
  - README: `README.md` contains practical commands for builds, local runs and cloud-specific notes — use it as the authoritative operations guide.

- Important conventions and patterns:
  - Module-per-deployment: each cloud target is a self-contained Maven module; modify its `pom.xml` to change compilation/packaging for that target.
  - Shade-generated files: `dependency-reduced-pom.xml` files in some modules are generated by the shade plugin — do not edit them manually.
  - Java versioning: many modules set `java.version` / `maven.compiler.*` (now mostly 21). Prefer changing the property in the module's `pom.xml` (or parent) rather than updating generated artifacts.
  - Lambda handlers: Java lambdas often use `edu.hebbible.Handler::handleRequest`. Spring Cloud Function uses `org.springframework.cloud.function.adapter.aws.FunctionInvoker::handleRequest`.

- Developer workflows (commands you can run locally):
  - Build Spring Boot service: `mvn --file sb3/pom.xml spring-boot:run` or `mvn -f sb3/pom.xml -T1C clean package`.
  - Package AWS Lambda (shade): `mvn clean package shade:shade` in `aws-lambda/` or the relevant module.
  - Java function frameworks: for Oracle Fn use `fn start` and `fn --verbose deploy --app java-app --local` (see `oracle-cloud-fn/` README lines in root `README.md`).
  - Gradle tasks (sb3 also has a Gradle build wrapper): from repo root: `./gradlew clean build`.
  - Python: `python3 -m venv env && source env/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && python3 app.py`.
  - Go: `go build ./...` and `go test ./...` in `go/`.
  - Tests: Maven tests via `mvn test` inside a module; Gradle `./gradlew test`; Python `pytest tests`.

- Integration and external dependencies:
  - AWS SDK / Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions, Alibaba/Tencent/Oracle function SDKs are each used in their own modules. Changes to shared code may require dependency bumps in multiple `pom.xml` files.
  - Docker is used for local images (see `sb3/Dockerfile` and top-level Docker instructions in `README.md`).
  - LocalStack, dynamodb-local, ollama, and other external tools are referenced in `README.md` for testing workflows.

- Helpful file examples (use these as templates):
  - `sb3/pom.xml` — Spring Boot app structure and dependency examples.
  - `aws-lambda/pom.xml` — shade plugin packaging and handler example.
  - `javafx/pom.xml` and `javafx/build.gradle` — JavaFX packaging; note maven/gradle differences.

- What agents should avoid:
  - Editing `dependency-reduced-pom.xml` or other generated build artifacts.
  - Assuming a single global `pom.xml` controls all modules — many modules are standalone.

- How to ask for help or make changes (best practices for PRs):
  - When proposing cross-cutting changes (API/data-format), create a short PR that updates one module first (the core library or `sb3/`) and then adds follow-up commits for cloud adapters.
  - Include exact commands to reproduce your build locally (module path + command). Example: `cd sb3 && mvn -T1C -DskipTests clean package`.
